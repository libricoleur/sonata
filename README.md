### About
This is a fork of Sonata Music Client for MPD ([http://sonata.berlios.de/](http://sonata.berlios.de/)).
I wanted to change the way the tray notification tooltip looked. From this:

to this:

Cover size can be set by changing NOTIFICATION_COVER_RATIO in consts.py.
Default is 2, for twice the original size. Also note that this is a quick hack.
### Patch
I made a patch for the latest stable version (1.6.2.1), see [https://gist.github.com/3843402)](https://gist.github.com/3843402).
